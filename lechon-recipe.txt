Ingredients
4 pounds whole pork belly
1 head garlic, pounded
2 tablespoons salt
1 tablespoon peppercorns
2 bay leaves
water
oil for deep frying

Instructions
In a pot over medium heat, combine pork belly, garlic, salt, peppercorns, bay leaves, and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top. Lower heat, cover and continue to cook for about 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until meat is tender but not falling apart.

Drain pork from liquid, discarding liquid. Wipe the pork dry, removing any stray aromatics. Place on a rack and refrigerate overnight to completely cool and dry.
In a deep, heavy-bottomed pot, heat enough oil to completely cover meat to about 350 F to 375 F. Carefully place meat into oil and fry until meat is golden and skin is crisp and puffed. While the meat is frying, regularly sprinkle about 1 tablespoon cold water onto the meat and hot oil every 5 minutes or so.

Remove meat from pot and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Let rest for about 5 minutes and then cut into serving pieces. Serve with lechon sauce or dip of choice.
Recipe Notes
Have butcher make a shallow cut through the rib bones to make chopping into serving pieces easier.
